# Infonexa

This repository contains the source code for the **Infonexa** marketing site, built with a modern React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn-ui stack.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS) and npm installed — for example via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

### Installation

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser to view the site.

### Production build

To create an optimized production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can then serve the contents of the generated `dist` directory using any static hosting provider (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, or your own server).

## Tech stack

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
